"SuperLuminate","Application","System","Prod","SuperLuminate",1,"SuperLuminate Application","The SuperLuminate application is the complete set of code, files, and database definitions that make up the SuperLuminate data dictionary application.","One purpose of the data dictionary is to provide consistency and understanding of common data across applications. Preplanning is a must to accomplish this at an enterprise level. A process must be clearly defined and key stakeholders identified. The process requires collecting information or metadata (data about the data) on each data element found to be common across domains. It is important to define up front what needs to be done before starting the dictionary. This includes defining what metadata will be collected on each element as well as what will not be collected. Examples of metadata include name of element, definition, application in which the data element is found, locator key, ownership, entity relationships, date first entered system, date element terminated from system, and system of origin.","Information systems are only as good as their data. Without a mutually agreed-upon set of data elements with clearly defined names and definitions, the validity and reliability of the data contained in a system are suspect at best and must be discounted at worst. The data dictionary and its relationship with the metadata registry are the foundation of an information system and the central building block that supports communication across business processes.

Standardizing data enhances interoperability across systems. It also improves data validity and reliability within, across, and outside the enterprise. Communication is improved in clinical treatment, research, and business processes through a common understanding of terms. Standardization provides developers with a common road map to promote consistency across applications.

Lack of a sound data dictionary can cause problems within and across organizations. Organizations may call the same data element by different names or they may call different data elements by the same name across an enterprise. As a result, an organization may not collect all of the information it needs or it may be unable to combine or map data across systems because the definitions are not identical. A worse possibility is that an organization may combine data elements it believes to be equivalent and draws incorrect inferences from the invalid data.
