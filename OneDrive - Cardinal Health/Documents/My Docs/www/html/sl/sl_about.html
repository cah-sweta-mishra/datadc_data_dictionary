<H3>About Pharma Data Dictionary</H3>
Pharma Data Dictionary is a fully functional, web based, thin client, open source extensible data dictionary application.
<P>
A data dictionary is important to any business or organization. The metadata in your data dictionary plays a key role in reacting quickly to new opportunities, reducing costs, and remain competitive.

<H3>Data Dictionary (definition)</H3>
A data dictionary is a tool for the collection and maintenance of Business and Technical definitions that are classified and cataloged by subject and then related to other definitions for ease of maintenance and retrieval.
<P>
Equally, the data dictionary maintains information about the definitions including:
<BR>
-- Security information - to track creator and modifier
<BR>
-- Version information -- to track changes to the definition
<BR>
-- Relationship information - to understand associations with other definitions
<P>
<H3>Metadata (definition)</H3>
In a data dictionary these definitions are commonly known as "metadata." Metadata is usually defined as "data about data", because metadata is itself data, and is used to describe other data or process.
<P>
Metadata is generally broken into two categories, Business metadata and Technical metadata. Business metadata defines your common business vocabulary; your policies, procedures, and rules. Technical metadata defines your physical data assets, your information systems infrastructure; your servers, databases, and reports.
</EM>
<P>
<H3>Based on Industry Standards</H3>
Pharma Data Dictionary is based on an industry standard architecture (The ANSI/ISO standards oganizations, Information Resources Dictionary System (IRDS)) that enables us to extend the functionality by modifying the out-of-the-box classification taxonomy and meta-schema, or by adding one or more of your own meta-schemas, e.g. Microsoft&reg; Open Information Model (OIM) meta-schema. All extensions to Pharma Data Dictionary can be accomplished by modifications to the underlying database forgoing any need to physically change the application.
