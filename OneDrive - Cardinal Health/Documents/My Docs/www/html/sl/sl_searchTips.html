<H3>Tips for Searching...</H3>
Context is key! Especially when looking for field mappings in the future state, please be careful to think about <strong>where</strong> in the process the data lives.
<P>
Much of Cardinal's data has the same business name but a different functionality depending on the business unit. Try to make your searches as specific as possible -avoid general terms like <q>sales</q> or <q>invoices</q> unless you can filter by one of the additional criteria below.
<P>
<p>
All searches in the dictionary with a red diamond (<span style="color:#ff0000">&#x2662;</span>) are wild card searches.
</p>
<H3>Search Criteria by Field</H3>
<strong><u>By WRICEF:</u></strong> &nbsp; If you are looking for a set of attributes related to a WRICEF object, you can input the <strong>WRICEF ID</strong> in this field. This is a wild card search available, but you should try to be as exact as possible.<P>
<ul>
<li>	If you are looking for a BSA, you can type <q>BSA</q> and the name of the report owner in this field to find the data attributes associated with that report.</li>

<ul>
<li> Please bear in mind that tower ownership is determined by design. E.g., PO # is owned by PTP when it appears on the PO, but might also appear on an RTR report with a different table name.</li> 
<li> Please note that all BSAs will be uploaded under the BIA tower.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
 <strong><u>By Subject Area:</u></strong> &nbsp; If you are looking for terms related to a set of business processes, you can try to search by <b>Subject Area</b>. There are currently 21 available values, with more set to be defined in PMOD 2. Use this if you feel confident in the usage of the needed field.
